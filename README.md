# CIAOS - CIA's Object Store

## About
CIAOS is a general purpose KV/Object store focused on workloads that require high throughput. Practical Applications which drives our developemt is to support Storage Disaggregation Architectures and AI/ML Workloads . 

## System Offerings that are currently being built. 
1. Storage - Key/Value, Files and Blobs. 
2. Fault Tolerance - Uses Erasure Coding to Optimise Data replication - Seeks contribution for design - [Discussion](https://github.com/cia-labs/Storage-service/issues/72)
3. User Access Management - Seeks contribution for design. [Discussion](https://github.com/cia-labs/Storage-service/issues/36)
4. Search - Seeks contribution for design. -   [Discussion](https://github.com/cia-labs/Storage-service/issues/35)
5. Availability - Seeks contribution for design. [Discussion]()
6. Client Library - Client package is currently available for Python only.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install ciaos
```

#### Configuration
To use CIAOS, you need to initialize a `Config` object with the necessary details:

- **`user_id`**: Your user ID .
- **`api_url`**: The URL of the storage server.
- **`user_access_key`**: Your user access key for authentication.

Here's how to set up and use the library:

```python
from ciaos import Ciaos,Config

# Initialize Config
config = Config(
    user_id="your_user_id", 
    api_url="https://api.ciaos.com",
    user_access_key="xxxx"
)

# Initialize CIAOS Client
ciaos_client = Ciaos(config)
```

### Functions and Usage

#### **Functionality**

- **`PUT`**: Uploads a file to the server using a unique key. If no key is provided, the filename is used as the key.

- **`PUT_BINARY`**: Uploads binary data to the server, accepting a list of binary data and associating it with a unique key.

- **`GET`**: Retrieves the binary data associated with a specific key.

- **`UPDATE`**: Updates the content of an existing key with new binary data, replacing the existing data.

- **`UPDATE_KEY`**: Renames the identifier (key) of existing data without changing the associated content.

- **`DELETE`**: Removes data associated with a specific key from the server.

- **`APPEND`**: Appends new binary data to an existing key without replacing the existing content.

### **Function Usage Examples**

#### **PUT**
- Upload a file to the server. Use the filename as the key if no `key` is provided.

```python
ciaos_client.put(file_path="path/to/your/file.txt", key="optional_unique_key")
```

#### **PUT_BINARY**
- Upload binary data to the server with a unique key.

```python
ciaos_client.put_binary(key="unique_key", data_list=[b"file1_binary", b"file2_binary_data"])
```

#### **GET**
- Retrieve the binary data associated with a specific key.

```python
data = ciaos_client.get(key="your_key")
```

#### **UPDATE**
- Replace the content of an existing key with new binary data.

```python
ciaos_client.update(key="your_key", data_list=[b"file1_updated_data", b"file2_updated_data"])
```

#### **UPDATE_KEY**
- Change the identifier (key) of existing data while retaining the associated content.

```python
ciaos_client.update_key(old_key="old_key", new_key="new_key")
```

#### **DELETE**
- Remove data associated with a specific key.

```python
ciaos_client.delete(key="your_key")
```

#### **APPEND**
- Add new data to an existing key without replacing the current content.

```python
ciaos_client.append(key="your_key", data_list=[b"additional_data"])
```
